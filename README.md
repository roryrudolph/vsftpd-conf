# vsftpd-conf
Comprehensive, default list of the vsftpd.conf options as copied from as copied from https://linux.die.net/man/5/vsftpd.conf

I don't take credit for any of this. While I was setting up my vsftpd server I noticed the vsftpd.conf example that ships with it was not comprehensive (because most users will not need all the possible options). I just wanted to put them all in one place to help me.
